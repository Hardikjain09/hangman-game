# Hangman Game

A simple Python implementation of the classic **Hangman game**. The game selects a random word from a list and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time before running out of attempts. With every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game picks a random word from a predefined list.
- **Visual Hangman Drawing**: The game displays a hangman figure that progressively gets completed with each wrong guess.
- **Lives System**: You have 6 lives. Every incorrect guess reduces one life.
- **Win and Loss Conditions**: The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
